# Credit Card Fraud Detection üí≥

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset of financial activities. By using advanced algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for detecting fraudulent transactions.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Fraud Detection**: Classifies transactions as either **Fraudulent** or **Legitimate**.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs various models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting** to achieve high accuracy.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and AUC score for model evaluation.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Uses techniques such as **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and **class weighting** to address class imbalance in the dataset.
- **Scalable System**: Code structure designed for scalability and easy integration with other applications.

## **Technologies Used**

| **Technology**       | **Description**                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**           | Core programming language for data preprocessing and model development |
| **Scikit-Learn**     | Machine learning library for implementing and evaluating models        |
| **Pandas/Numpy**     | For data manipulation and analysis                                     |
| **Matplotlib/Seaborn**| Data visualization for performance evaluation                         |
| **Flask**            | Lightweight web framework for deploying the model as a web service     |

## **Dataset**
The dataset used contains anonymized transaction details with the following features:
- **Time**: Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1-V28**: Principal components obtained using PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: Target variable where `0` indicates a legitimate transaction and `1` indicates fraud.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only ~0.17% of transactions being fraudulent.
